# yt2audio
Downloads youtube video, extracts the audio off it.

**UPDATE: ON HOLD. Downloading YouTube videos and distributing it is Illegal (and more importantly, Not cool). However, I think it's okay if I do this for personal use. Will continue when I know for sure.**

Early stage, ugly code, yada yada

TODOs:
- logging
- command line input
- proper error handling
- better file system structure
- use channels
- caching
